Project Description:
We are taking 10 years of NFL play by play data and running two different queries on the data.
1) A play breakdown query
   Input: Given a "situation" (field position, what down it is, how many yards to the first down, and a team)
   Output: A pie chart breakdown of what plays were chosen. Uses range queries to find plays matching the input

2) A play comparison query
   Input: Given a "situation" and two different play choices
   Output: Using range queries to identify plays matching that situation, compute the "expected value" of the
           play choice and display it to the user. If this query strategy doesn't work, perhaps use a KNN query
