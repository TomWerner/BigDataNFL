We talked about providing a probability distribution of the play choices (e.g. run 40%, punt 10%, pass 20%, etc). The user should be able to specify values or ranges for most (if not all) the attributes.

It may be interesting too that the user could specify the action and you can provide a recommendation (confidence) that the play will have a "good" outcome.

Prediction is based in K-NN classification?


Todo:
- Need to figure out how to identify runs
- Speed up queries, count is taking way too long
- Start work on expected value
- Improve options and integrate team picking into situation picking, not currently implemented.
